Name of this app:
Sticker Chart

Inspiration:
I wanted to make this app so that people could organize tasks, put them on a calendar and when they complete a days worth of tasks they could put a sticker
on that day to mark it complete

Progress:
So far I only have the task list part generated, I still need to make the calendar and the sticker catalog to choose from as well as buttons to add your tasks
to the calendar, to select a stick and to add the sticker to the calendar. I would like to add some fun images and gifs as well.
